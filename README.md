# Student Loan calculator
The second Angular project I ever worked on. A multi page that helps the user understands the costs and benefits they could have for dependents with special needs.

## Notes
to run, make sure to install angular by using `npm install @angular/cli`  
after that, simply run `ng serve` to run the program (can add `--open` for it to pop up automatically)
